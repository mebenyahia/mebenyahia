# Hi there, I'm Meryem! ðŸ‘‹
### I'm a âœ¨ Computer Science Graduate âœ¨

Problem-solving truly does call to all my passions :star_struck: 

I am always happy to help others, and will not hesitate to invest my personal time 
and effort into being everyone's go-to. 
Hard work, resilience, reliability and determination are key aspects in defining who I am!
